This repository contains some examples of my previous work:

1. **statsproject_RSA_ROI_Group1.m** is a decoding analysis on pre-processed fMRI data using representational similarity analysis (RSA). I worked on this alone for a statistics course.
2. **Go_no_go_task.m** is a simple behavioural experiment which I contributed in along with three other classmates. This was part of our coursework for our programming course.
3. **DeepMLP: From Pupil Activity to Neural Spiking PCs.ipynb** is a project in which I contributed during my participation in the Neuromatch Academy on Deep Learning. In this script, I coded from the section labeled 'Define MLPs' onwards to the end of the script, with the assistance of our teaching assistant. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed by one of my groupmates.

To provide context for this script, here is an excerpt from the abstract we wrote for this project: 'We selected a subset of the Steinmetz Neuropixel dataset (Steinmetz et al., 2019) to investigate whether neural spikes could be predicted from pupil dynamics and vice versa. As a proof of concept, we initially explored whether simple models could predict relationships between time-averaged data. We conducted PCA on the averaged neural spikes per trial. Utilizing time-averaged pupil size, x- and y-positions as input, and the first 40 principal components (PCs) as output (and vice versa), we constructed various Multilayer Perceptron models (MLPs) to predict the dynamics in both directions.'
